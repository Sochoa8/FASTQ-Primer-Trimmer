# FASTQ-Primer-Trimmer
This script provides a way to trim primers from FASTQ files. It was developed as part of my thesis to create a data-cleaning pipeline for Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) data from SELEX experiments. It serves as a general-purpose adapter trimmer for workflows where primer locations occur after adapters of various nucleotide lengths.
